# Android Tutorial for Beginners - Slidenerd

All source code available for the Android Tutorial for Beginners series from slidenerd.
The series is well structure, allowing the learning off core android concepts.
The concepts diverge from the more ones, e.g. life cycle to more structured e.g. fragments list view.

The repository has the same structure as the videos, as well the same order:
 - Part 1 - the basic
 - Part 2 - fragments
 - Part 3 - database
 - Part 4 - threads
